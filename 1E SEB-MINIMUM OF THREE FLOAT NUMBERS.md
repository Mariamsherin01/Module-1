# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Three Float Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the minimum between three float numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  
1.Read three float numbers from the user.
2.Use the ternary conditional expression to find the minimum value between the three numbers.
3.Print the result in the specified format showing the three numbers and the minimum value.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212222060143
# Name- Mariam Sherin
x=float(input())
y=float(input())
z=float(input())
print(f"The minimum of {x}, {y}, {z} is",min(x,y,z))
```
