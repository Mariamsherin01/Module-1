## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Divisibility of a Number by 9 

## AIM  
To write a Python program that reads an integer from the user and checks whether it is divisible by 9 using an if-else statement.
## ALGORITHM  
1.Read an integer input from the user.
2.Use the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 9.
3.If the result is 0, print that the number is divisible by 9.
4.Otherwise, print that the number is not divisible by 9.
## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212222060143
# Name- Mariam Sherin
# Read the number from the user
number = int(input())

# Check if the number is divisible by 9
if number % 9 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is divisible by 9")
else:
    print(f"{number} is NOT divisible by 9")

```
