# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Basic Arithmetic Operations on Two Integers.

## AIM
To write a Python program that reads two integers from the user and prints their sum, difference, and product.

## ALGORITHM
1.Read two integers from the user.
2.Calculate the sum of the two integers.
3.Calculate the difference (first - second).
4.Calculate the product and print all three results.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212222060143
#Name- Mariam Sherin
# Read the first integer
a = int(input())

# Read the second integer
b = int(input())

# Print the sum of the two numbers
print(a + b)

# Print the difference of the two numbers (first - second)
print(a - b)

# Print the product of the two numbers
print(a * b)


```
