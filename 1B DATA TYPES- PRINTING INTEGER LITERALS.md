# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Identifying the Type of a Literal Using Python

## AIM  
To write a Python program that reads input from the user, evaluates it using eval(), and prints the type of the literal entered.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Accept input from the user as a string.
2.Use the eval() function to evaluate the input as a Python literal.
3.Use the type() function to determine the type of the evaluated input.
4.Print the type of the literal.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212222060143
# Name- Mariam Sherin
a=eval(input())
print(type(a))

```
